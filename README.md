# Riak Client Tester Scripts

This unofficial Riak client tester scripts aims to get people started with developing w/ Riak. There are several instructions located on the start of the file to guide the user in using the script. The larger goal of this scripts is to provide a 'sanity check' for the bigger work in progress project to automate the generation of a Vagrant box with Riak OSS + all clients installed and tested working.

## Pre-requisites
- You need to have a Riak OSS or Enterprise installed and know its HTTP or Protocol Buffer hostname/IP and port.
- Take note that some of the scripts rely on a path where the Riak client libraries are installed.
